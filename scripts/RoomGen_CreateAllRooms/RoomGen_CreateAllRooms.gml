/* ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This is a wrapper script to create all the rooms in the room grid at once.
In your games THIS is the script you would normally call, as the single
room generation script is only designed for debugging, not for actual use,
although you can use it and generate a map visually for the player to see
if you wish, as shown in the DEMO object that comes with this asset.
